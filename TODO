Goal: remove the separate asset graph, and phase-specific code.

Desired state:
- a hopen file defines the cmd graph and nothing else
- MY.hopen.pl has data from earlier phases, plus options set by the user

To do:

- Update per Data::Hopen v0.0.19
  - Phase as a member of scope rather than as a parameter
  - Generator as a member of scope rather than as a parameter
    (related to #5)

- Data::Hopen::G::GraphBuilder: change `node` from a single node to an arrayref
  of nodes.
  - Make sure it's possible to do 1-1, many-1, and 1-many transforms in a builder
    - Maybe use instance methods on the builder instead of retval?

- Change H::files to return separate Cmd nodes that output the respective
  filenames

- Change C::compile to return a separate Compile node for each input node

- Add an Ah::Gen routine to accept a command from a toolset node

- Change the toolset nodes to make commands and pass them to that Gen
  routine directly, rather than creating an Asset node (which goes to the
  generator anyway)

- Remove the asset graph

- Add a command-line option to re-run all phases through Gen (for use in
  auto-rebuild rules)
