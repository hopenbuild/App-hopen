=head1 NAME

Build::Hopen::Conventions - conventions for using hopen(1) as a build system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

L<Build::Hopen> is a flexible dataflow processor and task runner.  However, its
main use case is as a build system (e.g., a Makefile generator).  To keep
the core of hopen as flexible as possible, hopen(1) (build-system use cases)
requires its components to follow the conventions described in this document.

These conventions are generally implemented/enforced in L<Build::Hopen::App>
and L<Build::Hopen::AppUtil>.

=head2 Components used by the build system

=over

=item Project directory

Where the main hopen file file of the project is (see L</"HOPEN FILES">).

=item Destination directory

Where the output will go.  hopen(1) does not support in-source builds.
The default directory is C<< <project dir>/built >>.

=item Generator

A subclass of L<Build::Hopen::Gen> that creates the build-system files.
The generator's job is to arrange for coordinating work that needs to be done.

=item Toolset

A collection of operations (L<Build::Hopen::G::Op> subclasses) that know
how to process specific types of files.  Toolsets are responsible for
defining the work that the generator will coordinate.

Toolsets are technically independent of which generator is in use.  However, a
command-line toolset probably won't work with an XML-based generator!  If no
toolset is specified, the generator picks the default.

=item An architecture (optional)

An arbitrary string understood by the toolset or generator.  Used, e.g.,
to select x86 vs. x64.

=item "Blueprint" files

These are the outputs of hopen.  They are the inputs to make(1), ninja(1), or
some other software-build tool.

=back

=head1 HOPEN FILES

hopen configures a project by running one or more files matching C<.hopen.pl>
or C<*.hopen.pl>.  As the extension suggests, these are Perl source files.

The filename C<MY.hopen.pl> is reserved.  It is created by hopen in each
destination directory to record the state of the build in that directory.

Hopen itself does not (knowingly) use any source filters, text replacement,
pluggable keywords, or other fancy features.  Everything in a hopen file is
straight Perl.

=head2 Which hopen files are used

On any hopen(1) run, up to three hopen files are automatically located and
executed.  (Any of those can run any number of additional hopen files.) None of
the three files has to exist.  The three files are, in order of execution:

=over

=item * Build-state file

The C<MY.hopen.pl> in the destination directory.  This sets the current
phase (see L</PHASES>) and loads the data output by the last hopen(1) run.

After C<MY.hopen.pl> runs, the generator and toolset are loaded.

=item * Project file

The last-sorting C<.hopen.pl> or C<*.hopen.pl> file in the project directory.
You can name your project file whatever you want --- only the extension
has to match.

=item * Context file

Sometimes you need to tweak the build of someone else's project to make it fit
your environment.  I run into this all the time on Cygwin.  Therefore, hopen
will look for a hopen file in the project's I<parent directory>.  That file is
referred to as a "context file".  Since the context file runs after the project
file, the context file can change the way the project will be built.

=back

After those files are executed, any code provided by a C<-e> command-line
option is executed as if it were its own hopen file on disk, and any
hopen file referenced by a C<-f> option is executed.  C<-e> and C<-f> options
are processed in the order given on the command line.

=head2 Execution environment of a hopen file

Each hopen file is the body of a subroutine that may return a hashref (C<{}>).
That hashref is provided as input to the build graph.  Each hopen file's output
hashref, if any, is appended to the input hashref (using L<Hash::Merge> with
retainment precedent).  Therefore, to leave the input unchanged, return
C<{}>, not C<$_[0]>.

Elements of the hashref starting with C<__R> are reserved.  Please don't read
or write those elements if you want hopen to work! :)  Similarly, all variables
starting with C<__R> are reserved.

The hopen file is executed in scalar context.

Each hopen file runs in an environment with everything from the following
packages loaded (via L<Build::Hopen::HopenFileKit>):

=over

=item L<Build::Hopen>

=item L<Build::Hopen::Base>

=item L<Build::Hopen::Phases>

=item L<Path::Class>

=back

=head2 Variables usable in hopen files

These are defined in L<Build::Hopen>.

=over

=item $Generator

The current L<Build::Hopen::Gen> instance.

=item $Toolset

The name of the current C<< Build::Hopen::T::<stem> >> package root.

=item $Build

The L<Build::Hopen::G::DAG> instance representing the current build.
Goals in C<$Build> will become, e.g., top-level targets of a
generated C<Makefile>.

=item $Phase

The current phase (B<read-only>).  Only C<MY.hopen.pl> is allowed to change
the phase (and not even that if C<--phase> is specified on the hopen
command line).

=back

=head1 PHASES

hopen is a multi-phase build system.  Unlike cmake(1), hopen runs
deterministically in multiple steps.  That way you don't have to run the build
generator over and over again until it converges.  (Yes, I have had this
problem with cmake.)  Each time you run hopen(1), it will run the next phase
(saved in C<MY.hopen.pl>).  Currently, the phases are as follows, in order.

=head2 Check

During this phase, the generator, toolset, or hopen file can collect
information about the environment.

=head2 Gen

During this phase, blueprint files and any supporting files
(e.g., a C<config.h>) are written to the destination directory.

=head2 After all the phases are run

Once all of hopen's phases have been run, you can run make(1), ninja(1), or
whatever build system corresponds with the generator you have selected.
You can do this by running C<hopen --build>, if you wish.
